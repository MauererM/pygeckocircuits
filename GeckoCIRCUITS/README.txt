****************************************


Copy the content of the CD (or zip-file) onto your hard-disk. 


GeckoCIRCUITS does not need installation. Please just double-click the 
file GeckoCIRCUITS.jar to start the simulator. A Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) has to be installed on your computer. If you don't have Java on
your computer, then please follow e.g. the link http://www.java.com/de/download/
for the free Java-download. Please ensure to install the correct Java
runtime for your computer (64-bit version for 64-bit operating systems).

After running a simulation, you can see the simulation results via the 
SCOPE block (double-click green blocks with multiple inputs).
